# AR-Navigation-for-the-Visually-Impaired
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of Augmented Reality Software Development Kit (SDK), **ARKitâ€™s** *Ray-casting* as an approach to evaluate how far real-world objects are detected in an indoor environment.  The aim was to explore the feasibility of combining *Cloud Computing* with **ARKit's** *SDK* for the purpose of obstacle avoidance and navigation for the blind using an **iOS** (*Apple* mobile operating system) mobile device.
